### Customer Behavior:
•	Customers from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro represent the majority of orders.
•	Repeat customers tend to leave higher review scores and have shorter wait times.

### Product Category Trends:
•	Bed & Bath, Health & Beauty, and Sports & Leisure dominate in volume.
•	Some niche categories like Books, Fashion Accessories, and Musical Instruments have higher average ratings.
•	Product categories with high volume also tend to have longer delivery times due to demand and stocking issues.

### Delivery Performance:
•	The average delivery time is 12 days, but varies widely by region and seller.
•	Orders with faster delivery times are strongly correlated with higher review scores.

### Reviews & Customer Satisfaction:
•	High review scores (5 stars) make up about 60% of the total.
•	Most negative reviews cite late delivery or product not matching description.
•	Neutral reviews (3 stars) are typically associated with long delivery but acceptable product quality.

### Seller Performance:
•	A small percentage (about 10%) of sellers contribute to over 50% of the total orders.
•	Top sellers tend to have better ratings, faster delivery, and lower return rates.
•	New or low-volume sellers show high variability in performance, often due to inventory or shipping constraints.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Brazilian eCommerce dataset highlights the growing complexity and opportunity in Brazil’s digital retail sector. While the market is vibrant and diverse in product offerings, key challenges remain in delivery logistics and seller consistency. Customer satisfaction is closely linked to delivery times, and efficient fulfillment processes are a strong differentiator in this competitive space.
The presence of a few dominant sellers and cities suggests market concentration, while niche product categories show potential for differentiation through superior service and branding.
